- OsiCpx message handling - seeing all messages twice
- projection for blocks to save memory (see SSR)
- clean-up and document parameter names
- Relax and Cut ---> what to do if no UB!?
  -- for now, force user to give some idea
- Decomp and Cut - first just do normal CPM + DC idea with farkas working
  --> from multi-poly.... 
  --> even during PC, x* --> decomp from other poly, then farks
- Volume -> DecompAlgoVC? or direct DecompVol?
- DecompInterface Idea
- parameters need to be stored in algo, if doing multi-poly... 
- really need multiple DecompModels? stored as a DecompApp?
- if depend on COIN or Alps
- UtilCoin, UtilAlps, ... others should be completely independent of COIN
