DIP (Decomposition in Integer Programming) is a framework for
implementing a wide variety of decomposition-based algorithms for solving
integer programs, including full generic column generation in which the user
need only indicate whic constraints to relax and the framework takes care of
all other aspects of the column-generation. The problem can be specified using
[DiPPy](https://pypi.org/project/coinor.dippy/), an extension of the
Python-based modeling language [PuLP](https://github.com/coin-or/PuLP) (see
[examples](Dip/src/dippy/examples)). If desired, custom subroutines for solving
the subproblem, branching, heuristics, etc. can be implemented in pure Python
and called automatically from C++ during execution of the algorithm.

Dip makes it easy to implement and compare different variety of
decomposition-based algorithm while keeping as many details of the algorithmic
implem,entation constant as possible, allowing for rigorous empirical
comparisons.

Using [DiPPy](https://pypi.org/project/coinor.dippy/), one can even implement
a full column-generation algorithm within an Excel spreadsheet using [Solver
Studio](http://solverstudio.org). See screen shots below.

Dip is written in C++ and is released as open source under the [Eclipse Public License 2.0](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/eclipse-2.0).

It is distributed under the auspices of the [COIN-OR Foundation](https://www.coin-or.org).

## DOWNLOAD

What follows is a quick start guide for obtaining or building
Dip on common platforms. More detailed information is
available [here](https://coin-or.github.io/user_introduction.html).

### Docker image

There is a Docker image that provides Dip, as well as other projects
in the [COIN-OR Optimization
Suite](https://github.com/coin-or/COIN-OR-OptimizationSuite) [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/coinor/coin-or-optimization-suite)

### Binaries

For newer releases, binaries will be made available as assets attached to
releases in Github
[here](https://github.com/coin-or/Dip/releases). Older binaries
are archived as part of Dip
[here](https://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/Dip).

 * *Linux* (see https://repology.org/project/coin-or-dip/versions for a complete listing): 
   * arch:
     ```
     $ sudo pacman -S  coin-or-dip
     ```
   * Debian/Ubuntu:
     ```
     $ sudo apt-get install  coinor-dip coinor-libdip-dev
     ```
   * Fedora/Redhat/CentOS:
     ```
     $ sudo yum install  coin-or-Dip coin-or-Dip-devel
     ```
   * freebsd:
     ```
     $ sudo pkg install math/dip
     ```
   * linuxbrew:
     ```
     $ brew install dip
     ```
 * *Windows*: The easiest way to get Dip on Windows is to download an archive as described above.
 * *Mac OS X*: The easiest way to get Dip on Mac OS X is through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
     ```
     $ brew tap coin-or-tools/coinor
     $ brew install coin-or-tools/coinor/dip
     ```

* *conda* (cross-platform, no Windows for now):
     ```
     $ conda install coin-or-dip
     ```

Due to license incompatibilities, pre-compiled binaries lack some 
functionality. If binaries are not available for your platform for the latest 
version and you would like to request them to be built and posted, feel free 
to let us know on the mailing list. 

### Source

Source code can be obtained either by

 * Downloading a snapshot of the source code for the latest release version of Dip from the
 [releases](https://github.com/coin-or/Dip/releases) page,
 * Cloning this repository from [Github](https://github.com/coin-or/Dip), or 
 * Using the [coinbrew](https://github.com/coin-or/coinbrew) script to get the project and all dependencies (recommended, see below).   

### Dependencies

Dip has a number of dependencies, which are detailed in
[config.yml](.coin-or/config.yml). Dependencies on other COIN-OR projects are
automatically downloaded when obtaining the source with `coinbrew`. For some
of the remaining third-party dependencies, automatic download scripts and
build wrappers are provided (and will also be automatically run for required
and recommended dependencies), while other libraries that are aeasy to obtain
must be installed using an appropriate package manager (or may come with your
OS by default). 

## BUILDING from source

These quick start instructions assume you are in a bash shell. 

### Using `coinbrew`

To download and build Dip from source, execute the 
following on the command line. 
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coin-or/coinbrew/master/coinbrew
chmod u+x coinbrew
./coinbrew fetch Dip@0.95.1
./coinbrew build Dip
```
For more detailed instructions on coinbrew, see https://coin-or.github.io/coinbrew.
The `coinbrew` script will fetch the additional projects specified in the Dependencies section of [config.yml](.coin-or/config.yml).

### Without `coinbrew` (Expert users)

 * Download the source code, e.g., by cloning the git repo https://github.com/coin-or/Dip
 * Download and install the source code for the dependencies listed in [config.yml](.coin-or/config.yml)
 * Build the code as follows (make sure to set PKG_CONFIG_PTH to install directory for dependencies).

```
./configure -C
make
make test
make install
```

## Quickstart with DIP/DipPy

If you are on Linux or OS X, DIP can be installed from source using
[coinbrew](https://github.com/coin-or/coinbrew) (see below). In Windows, there
are pre-built binary wheels for DipPy. After build and install of DIP, if you
are installing DipPy, make sure to set `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` to point to the
directory where the `.pc` files are installed (by default, this is in the
`lib/pkgconfig` directory in the installation directory). You may also need to
set either `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (Linux) or `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` (OS X) to point to
the directory where the libraries are installed. Then simply do
```
pip install coinor.dippy
```

After installation, you can try running the examples to see if trhings are
working. These should all work out of the box. For a listing of examples and
some brief instructions, do
```
python -m coinor.dippy.examples
```
To get help for an example, do, e.g.,
```
python -m coinor.dippy.example.cflp --help
```
or just run
```
python -m coinor.dippy.examples.cflp
```

## Doxygen Documentation

If you have `Doxygen` available, you can build a HTML documentation by typing

`make doxydoc` 

in the build directory. If Dip was built via `coinbrew`, then the build
directory will be `./build/Dip/0.95.1` by default. The doxygen documentation main file
is found at `<build-dir>/doxydoc/html/index.html`.

If you don't have `doxygen` installed locally, you can use also find the
documentation [here](http://coin-or.github.io/Dip/Doxygen).

   subproblem solver is used and to allow no branching candidates when 
   branching. 

### Release 0.91.6

 * Fixed bug in DipPy having to do with branching.

### Release 0.92.1
 * Fixed problem with dependency linking

### Release 0.92.0
 * Substantially re-designed internals
 * Renamed classes, functions, and parameters more intuitively

 * In DipPy, the user can now return a status in the subproblem solve to
   indicate whether the subproblem was solved exactly. Previously, DipPy
   solved the subproblem to optimality internally whenever no solution was
   returned, which is unnecessary if the user's subproblem solver is exact. It
   also means that the user was previously required to provide a full
   description of the subproblem.
