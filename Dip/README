CHANGELOG
=========

## Release 0.92.3
 * Update dependencies
 * Minor bug fix
 * Add support for Appveyor and Travis
 * Install examples with DipPy

## Release 0.92.2
 * Get rid of pesky global variable DecompInf
 * Fix bugs in wedding planner example
 * Fix bugs in DipPy to allow returning no solutions, even when an exact 
   subprobem solver is used and to allow no branching candidates when 
   branching. 

## Release 0.91.6
 * Fixed bugs in Wedding Planner example.
 * Fixed bug in DipPy having to do with branching.

## Release 0.92.1
 * Fixed problem with dependency linking

## Release 0.91.5
 * Fixed bug with SYMPHONY when not all solutions are accepted.

## Release 0.92.0
 * Substantially re-designed internals
 * Renamed classes, functions, and parameters more intuitively
 * Eliminated unnecessary "MILP" parameter section and joined it to "DECOMP,"
   as well as making "DECOMP" the default parameter section name. 
 * Changed parameter setting mechanism to make it possible to pass parameters
   directly to solvers using native names.
 * Added interface to Gurobi
 * Added ability to select solver at run-time rather than compile-time.
 * In DipPy, the user can now return a status in the subproblem solve to
   indicate whether the subproblem was solved exactly. Previously, DipPy
   solved the subproblem to optimality internally whenever no solution was
   returned, which is unnecessary if the user's subproblem solver is exact. It
   also means that the user was previously required to provide a full
   description of the subproblem.

## Release 0.91.4
 * Fixed bugs in examples
 * Updates to dependencies
 * Samll bug fixes

## Release 0.91.3
 * Fixes for correctly producing Doxygen documentation

## Release 0.91.2
 * Fixed issue with master only variable when solving master as an integer
   program.
 * Added ability to generate multiple columns per iteration with SYMPHONY and
   Cbc.

## Release 0.91.1
 * Updating dependencies.
 * Fix for dependency linking
 * Fix to installation with {{{DESTDIR}}}

## Release 0.91.0
 * Multiple parallel modes added
   * Solution of individual subproblems can be parallelized
   * Multiple subproblems can be solved simultaneously
   * Multiple algorithms can be executed in parallel (branch and cut plus
        one or more decomposition-based algorithms)
 * Warm starting for solutions of subproblems is supported when using
   SYMPHONY as the subproblem solver. 
 * Unbounded feasible regions now supported.
 * Explicit treatment of master-only variables.

 * Fixes to Python installation

 * Fix to DipPy

## Release 0.9.0:

 * DIP now includes DipPy, a Python-based modeling language.

 * DIP is now a complete generic MILP solver, capable of automatically
   detecting block structure and applying a decomposition method.

 * DIP and DipPy build out of the box in Windows, OSX, and Linux with a
   combination of the autotools and a Python setup script.

 * There is now support for solving the subproblems in parallel when there is
   block structure using OpenMP.

 * Numerous bug fixes and improvements.
